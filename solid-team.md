## Solid Leader
The Solid Leader defines the governing mission and vision of Solid, along with key factors for success, which are manifested in the Solid Roadmap. They are the de-facto head of Solid, as well as the leading member of the Solid Team.

## Solid Manager
The Solid Manager is responsible for coordination and facilitation across the Solid Team, Solid Panels, and the greater Solid Community. They aim to foster collaboration across these groups in the ultimate goal of realizing the Solid Mission by fulfilling the Solid Roadmap.

The Solid Manager is responsible for moderating the W3C Solid Community Group calls, as well as keeping the Solid information up to date. Consequently, they must ensure that Solid information repositories are well-organized, and communicate any changes clearly and publicly.

The Solid Manager is responsible for encouraging and supporting Solid Event organizers and other constructive community events and activities.

## Solid Team Member
All members of the Solid Team (including Solid Leader and Solid Manager) are tasked with advancing the Solid Mission through their work supporting the Solid Roadmap. Responsibilities for any given Solid Team member may include but are not limited to those items listed in the [Solid Team Mandate](governance.md#team-mandate).

Solid Team members have admin rights on all Solid repositories, managed properties and assets, and communication channels. They are expected both to participate in regular community group meetings and to maintain availability for project-specific collaboration as needed.
