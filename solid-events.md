(past events are [listed below](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-events.md#past-events))

Solid Events are run by members of the Solid community like you. Here you can 
find a comprehensive guide to help you along the way. Reach out to the Solid 
Manager to set up a call and brainstorm the organisation of your event. 

Solid Events are a good vehicle to build a local network interested in using and working on Solid. 

# Solid Event Triplet Programme  
A possible format is to hold a triplet of incrementally engaging Solid Events in the same city. 

*First Solid Event: Meet and Greet* 
The first Solid Event in a city is an opportunity to gather local interest for a meet and greet. During the first Solid Event in a city a general introduction is helpful to make sure there is a common understanding and there is an opportunity to ask questions and discuss local applications. 

Questions to answer in the opening introduction include: 
* What is Solid? 
* Why should I use Solid?
* How can I use Solid?

The [FOSDEM talk by Ruben Verborgh](http://bofh.nikhef.nl/events/FOSDEM/2019/Janson/solid_web_decentralization.mp4) 
is a great introduction if you'd prefer to screen a recording. 

Demos of Solid solutions preferably by locals building on Solid help the audience 
focus on practical implementations. You can also ask Solid app developers for 
recorded demos. 

Solid Chat Challenges are set by defining a common goal, for example building a Solid chat app. Ideally you have a Challenge leader to give support and guidance throughout the challenge. Possibly partnering with a local university as part of a course is a good way to provide structure to the challenge and engage with students. Set the challenge criteria carefully and clearly as well as the jury. 

At the end of your first Solid Event it’s a good idea to announce a local Solid Chat Challenge. Possibly you will first want to understand local interest before defining the details however make sure to announce it and collect contact details at the first Solid Event. Follow up by sending a written description of the local Solid Chat Challenge. 

*Second Solid Event: Solid Chat Challenge prize ceremony with an invitation for local companies and institutions* 
The prize ceremony is an opportunity to touch base, recognise efforts made, and share experiences. 

You can collect feedback in a written form too to understand how the local community found the experience. The Solid Team are also interested in hearing feedback to see how to improve the on boarding developer experience. 

Make sure to invite local companies and institutions to the Sold Chat Challenge prize ceremony. You may want to start the ceremony with a presentation for the local companies to understand Solid and the local Solid challenge. The ambition of inviting local companies and institutions is to connect them with those who have built on Solid so that they can implement Solid into local implementations. 

*Third Solid Event: Demonstration of work by local commercial bodies* 
The third Solid Event in your city is a good opportunity for local companies and institutions to share their experiences of local implementation of Solid. It is likely that these implementations are still in early stages. The benefit of meeting is that you can ensure interoperable practices on a local level from inception.
A general introduction to Solid to kickstart your Solid Event can be helpful for 
newcomers and to warm the attention of the crowd. If your event is general and 
targeted to a wide audience using Solid or looking to use Solid, it is important 
that you cover What, Why, How, When, described so anyone can understand. It is 
useful to talk about the core values that define the Solid design. Value based 
conversations can be an excellent route to moving these conversations forward. 

## Speakers 
Solid Events are a great opportunity to highlight local people building on Solid. 
Reach out to the Solid Team and ask  solid/chat on gitter to see if there are 
people local to you. 

## Debate Panel  
If you decide to set up a debate panel, define a theme or opening question. One 
way to focus the conversation is to set it up as a debate panel with multiple 
teams defending a specific perspective. Allocating people to defend perspectives 
they do not necessarily agree with is a good way to open the mind and expand 
the debate.

## Entrepreneur-Investor Pitching 
One format is to invite local entrepreneurs and developers to pitch an idea 
for a Solid app or Pod Provider. You can also invite investors to pitch why 
their funds are appropriate for Solid values.

## Hackathons 
Hackathons are great for passing on knowledge between those who are familiar 
with Solid to those who are learning. It is useful to have a concrete target 
for your hackathon that you can work towards together. There is a collection 
of educational materials available at [Solid Teaching Materials](solid-resources.md). 

# Team 
A good team can make all the difference. Examples of roles include: 
- promotion 
- ticketing 
- equipment support 
- presentation host

# Venue
Partnering with existing meetups or organisations that regularly host events has 
the benefit of learning from their experience and benefit from their existing 
setup. Make sure to select a venue that can accommodate the number of people 
you expect with sufficient tables and chairs. 

# Equipment
Organising a projector, sound system, and laptop for displaying the presentation 
in advance is important for a smooth running event. Make sure you have the right 
cables and preferably do a trial run before the event. If you partner with a venue 
that is familiar with hosting events, make sure to know who to contact about 
equipment setup. 

# Invitation 
Eventbrite and Meetup provide invitation services that have been popular with 
Solid Event Organisers. A standard Solid Event invite text could be:
