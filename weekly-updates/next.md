# 5th September 2019

Hello and welcome to another issue of This Week in Solid!

[Solid](https://solid.github.io/information/) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along. If you have a suggestion on how to improve this description you may be interested in [joining the Explaining the Vision panel](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/panels.md#explaining-the-vision-panel) who are working on describing [Solid in a Nutshell](https://github.com/solid/Explaining-the-Vision-Panel). 

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.
