### Reviewed Solid Proposals
Candidate proposals to the Solid Specification, Solid Roadmap, or Supporting Documentation submitted for review go through an editorial process before they are accepted. You can read more about the details of the submission and review process of proposals [here](https://github.com/solid/culture#how-to-make-changes). This week the roles are still being reviewed so the editorial process is on hold. 

### New and Updated Apps, Pods, and Identity Providers
If you have any new [apps](https://github.com/solid/solid-apps), [Pods](https://github.com/solid/pods), or [identity providers](https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list) make sure to add them to the list so they get included in next weeks edition.

This week there was a new app: 
* [SolidVC](https://github.com/kezike/solid-vc) is a [Verifiable Credentials](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) framework developed within the context of Solid | [Source Code](https://github.com/kezike/solid-vc) | [MIT License Copyright (c) 2018](https://github.com/kezike/solid-vc/blob/master/LICENSE) [Kayode Ezike](https://github.com/kezike)

There have also been updates to: 
* [vue-solid-plugin](https://github.com/JordanShurmer/vue-solid-plugin) allowing you to load data from the Type Registry extremely easily! See the README for all the details. Still a version 0 plugin, so things may be changing, but it's usable for sure. [![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue-solid-plugin.svg)](http://npmjs.com/package/vue-solid-plugin)
