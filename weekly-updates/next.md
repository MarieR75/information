# 22nd August 2019

Hello and welcome to another issue of This Week in Solid!

[Solid](https://solid.github.io/information/) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

If you have a suggestion on how to improve this description you may be interested in [joining the Explaining the Vision panel](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/panels.md#explaining-the-vision-panel) who are working on describing [Solid in a Nutshell](https://github.com/solid/Explaining-the-Vision-Panel). 

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress. 

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org or [send a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/edit/master/weekly-updates/next.md). Want to get involved? [Contributions are welcome](https://github.com/solid/information#develop).

This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](./next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/pulls).

## Updates on Solid Projects
[Solid projects](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) are activities happening on the Solid GitHub other than panesl. Below are the links to where there were active conversations on each of the projects. 

### [Node Solid Server Project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects/2) 
* [Resource-mapper now considers content type when inserting index.html](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/pull/1260#issuecomment-521680894)
* [500 error when testing NSS5](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/issues/1134#issuecomment-521883740)
* [fix issues #1120 #1256 from NSS5.1.6 ressource-mapper](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/pull/1282/files/58e1a479c5dbec944e32676356ffd1b5ca0ed88d..05153ae3fb29c37b8231178515a074b2133fa558)

### [Data Browser Project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects/4)
A number of libraries that together combine to form the data browser have seen a version 1 release. More specifically, this concerns [mashlib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mashlib), [solid-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mashlib) and [rdflib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mashlib).

These releases do not contain major changes; rather, marking them as v1 merely represents the reality of trying not to introduce breaking changes to them.

## Tasks
If you are keen to get started but are not sure where, check out the [list of tasks](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/tasks.md). If you need help on something specific or know of something that would be useful to do make sure it's listed by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/tasks.md)
* [Add trashcan and file upload buttons next to camera button](https://github.com/solid/contacts-pane/pull/3)
