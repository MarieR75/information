Here is a little overview of active conversations this week.

### Reviewed Solid Proposals
Candidate proposals to the Solid Specification, Solid Roadmap, or Supporting Documentation submitted for review go through an editorial process before they are accepted. You can read more about the details of the submission and review process of proposals [here](https://github.com/solid/culture#how-to-make-changes). This week the roles are still being reviewed so 

### New and Updated Apps, Pods, and Identity Providers
If you have any new [apps](https://github.com/solid/solid-apps), [Pods](https://github.com/solid/pods), or [identity providers](https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list) make sure to add them to the list so they get included in next weeks edition.

* Updates to the [vue-solid-plugin](https://github.com/JordanShurmer/vue-solid-plugin) allowing you to load data from the Type Registry extremely easily! See the README for all the details. Still a version 0 plugin, so things may be changing, but it's usable for sure. [![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue-solid-plugin.svg)](http://npmjs.com/package/vue-solid-plugin)
