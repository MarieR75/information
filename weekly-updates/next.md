# 19th September 2019

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Solid*!

[Solid](https://solid.github.io/information/) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along. If you have a suggestion on how to improve this description you may be interested in [joining the Explaining the Vision panel](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/panels.md#explaining-the-vision-panel) who are working on describing [Solid in a Nutshell](https://github.com/solid/Explaining-the-Vision-Panel).

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org or [send a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/edit/master/weekly-updates/next.md). Want to get involved? [Contributions are welcome](https://github.com/solid/information#develop).

This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](./next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/pulls).

## Weekly Solid Call
Every Thursday there is an hour long public call where newcomers can introduce themselves, anyone can ask general questions about Solid, and we recap the weeks works on Solid.

You can read the [minutes of this weeks call here]().

Next weeks call will be on the 19th September at 1000CEST on [this line](https://zoom.us/j/121552099). You can find [the agenda here]() where you can also add items by [joining the W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) or send an email to info@solidproject.org.

### Solid Data Workers
NLNet Foundation [has accepted](https://nlnet.nl/project/SOLIDdataworkers/) the application to the NGI0 PET Fund for the Solid Data Workers project, which aims to populate and enrich the personal linked data graph hosted in a Solid pod by fetching data from existing sources through dedicated applications (called "Workers"). You can find progress notes about the various components involved in the project - still in a very early stage - at https://semantic.builders/

## Updates on Solid Projects
[Solid projects](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) are activities happening on the Solid GitHub other than panels. Below are the links to where there were active conversations on each of the projects.

### [Node Solid Server Project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects/2)

### [Data Browser Project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects/4)
A number of libraries that together combine to form the data browser have seen a version 1 release. More specifically, this concerns [mashlib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mashlib), [solid-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mashlib) and [rdflib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mashlib).
**_ `solid-ui` and `rdflib` links need correction _**

These releases do not contain major changes; rather, marking them as v1 merely represents the reality of trying not to introduce breaking changes to them.

[Solid projects](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) are activities happening on the Solid GitHub other than panels. 

## Tasks
If you are keen to get started but are not sure where, check out the [list of tasks](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/tasks.md). If you need help on something specific or know of something that would be useful to do make sure it's listed by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/tasks.md)

Until next week!
