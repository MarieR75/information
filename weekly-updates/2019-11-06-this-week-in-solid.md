# 31st October 2019

Hello and welcome to another edition of *This Week in Solid*!

[Solid](https://solid.github.io/information/) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along. If you have a suggestion on how to improve this description you may be interested in [joining the Explaining the Vision panel](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/panels.md#explaining-the-vision-panel) who are working on describing [Solid in a Nutshell](https://github.com/solid/Explaining-the-Vision-Panel).

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org or [send a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/edit/master/weekly-updates/next.md). Want to get involved? [Contributions are welcome](https://github.com/solid/information#develop).

This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/solid/information/edit/master/weekly-updates/next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/pulls).

## Weekly Solid Call
Every Thursday there is an hour long public call where newcomers can introduce themselves, anyone can ask general questions about Solid, and we recap the weeks works on Solid.

You can read the [minutes of this weeks call here]().

Next weeks call will be on the 17th October at 1000CEST on [this line](https://zoom.us/j/121552099).

## Solid Development
The scope of work that needs to happen on the Solid specification has been written down as issues which you can read [here](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues). If you feel something is missing from the scope of the Solid specification [submit an issue](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues). On Friday the [editors](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/editors.md) will define which issues to include in the [milestone](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestone/1) to be delivered on December 19th which will define the focus of work until then.

## Updates on Solid Projects
