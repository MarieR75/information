# 17th October 2019 

Hello and welcome to another edition of This Week in Solid!

Solid is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Solid Implementations

The Node Solid Server 5.2.0 was released. This includes a new version of the Solid Data Browser and a much needed fix to the handling of content-types. 

If you have any new apps, Pods, or identity providers, or there are updates to existing Solid implementations, make sure to add them to the list so they get included in next week's edition.

Until next week!
