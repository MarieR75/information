# Solid Panels

Solid Panels are individual groups focused on a specific technical or non-technical domain that are sanctioned by the Solid Team. For information on how Solid Panels are governed, see [Solid Governance](decision-making-processes.md).

# Proposed Solid Panels

Proposed Solid Panels are subject to a majority vote by the Solid Team.

## Specification Panel

The purpose of the Specification Panel is to ensure that the Solid Specification is complete, robust, and evolves in alignment with the Solid Roadmap, and to provide advice and guidance to those looking to create specification compliant implementations.

The first proposed initiative, to be started immediately, is for this panel to commence the creation of the v1.0 Solid Specification.

## Security Panel

The purpose of the Security Panel is to ensure that the Solid security model is well-documented, comprehensive, and constantly evolving, as well as to provide security-related advice and guidance to other panels, and to the Solid Team.

The first proposed initiative, to be started immediately, is for this panel to commence with the creation of an in-depth documentation of the Solid security model.

## Interoperability Panel

Interoperability of data across applications is crucial to the core value proposition of Solid. The purpose of the Interoperability Panel is to ensure that Solid is always capable of delivering robust interoperability, and that tooling and resources are available to foster the same.

The first proposed initiative, to be started immediately, is for the panel to commence with a proposal for data discovery by client applications in a Solid Pod.
