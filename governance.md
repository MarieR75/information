# Solid Governance
This document defines the formal governance process for Solid, and records how this has changed over time. Currently, governance is provided by the Solid Team, who may also consult one or more Solid Panels for direction via a vote on occasion. The Solid Team has the great responsibility to exercise their authority when necessary to ensure the viability and integrity of Solid, while at the same time fostering a collaborative, transparent, and supportive environment for contribution.

The Solid Leader heads the Solid Team, and sanctions this governance structure. The Solid Leader can veto decisions and adjust direction as they see fit.

# Solid Team

The [Solid Team](solid-team.md) are dedicated stewards of the Solid Project, tasked with realizing the Solid Mission by supporting the fulfillment of the Solid Roadmap.

The Solid Team fulfills [roles and responsibilities](solid-team.md#solid-team-roles) necessary to realize the Solid mission and provide an effective means of governance. Individuals occupying these roles were appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Solid Leader.

## Team Mandate

The mandate of the Solid Team includes but is not limited to:

* __Solid Roadmap__ - Curation of the Solid Roadmap, comprised of the Solid Mission, Solid Values, and Key Success Factors. The Solid Team works to ensure that any and all decisions, priorities, and output are always in alignment with the Solid Roadmap.
* __Solid Specification__ - Guiding the evolution of the Solid Specification, with an aim to encourage constructive dialogue and foster changes that result in healthy successive iterations aligned with the Solid Roadmap.
* __Solid Panel__ - Sanction of new [Solid Panels](#solid-panels), as well as initiatives or duties associated with a Panel. Also includes voting on Panel nominees.
* __Solid Projects__ - Sanction and oversight of any repositories hosted under the [Solid GitHub organization](https://github.com/solid/), including sanctioned initiatives undertaken by Solid Panel groups and/or the Solid Team, and open source community reference implementations of the Solid Specification in different languages and technical stacks.
* __Solid Website__ - Curation and Management of the [Solid Website](https://www.solidproject.org).
* __Solid Brand__ - Definition and evolution of the Solid Brand, including any associated brand assets.
* __Solid Evangelism__ - Fostering awareness and use of Solid across geographic, economic, industrial, and academic verticals.
* __Solid Compliance__ - Creation and curation of the [Solid Test Suite](https://github.com/solid/test-suite), which any Solid specification compliant server must pass to be considered a fully compliant implementation.
* __Solid Communication Channels__ - Sanction and oversight of official Solid project communication mediums, such as chatrooms, forums, mailing lists, and message boards.
* __Solid Participation__ - Make contributing and/or participating in the evolution of Solid as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible.
* __Solid Governance__ - Establish and foster appropriate decision-making processes, ensuring that decisions and associated processes are always aimed towards furtherance of the Solid mission, and supportive of a healthy and beneficent Solid ecosystem. Where necessary, act as a court of final appeal for decisions where all other methods have failed.

## Decision Making

Transparency in the decision making process is important. Decisions will be documented along with the rationale and considerations taken into account around a given decision. The Solid Team always strives to operate in a manner that aims for team consensus without the need for formalized voting.

For any substantial decisions where consensus cannot be reached, the Solid Team votes. The Solid Leader can always veto the voting outcome. Every Solid Team member must either vote or explicitly abstain. Passing requires a strict majority of non-abstaining Solid Team members. Stalemates are resolved by the Solid Leader.

The Solid Team utilizes the decision making framework [articulated herein](#decision-making-process).

## Vacancies

Solid Team members may resign their position at any time. They may also be removed by a majority vote of the rest of the Solid Team. The Solid Leader reserves the right to remove any Solid Team member at any time. Whenever there is a vacancy on the Solid Team, a new team member will be nominated and selected through the mechanism [articulated herein](#team-nominations-and-member-selection).

Solid Team members may take a leave of absence for sickness, pregnancy, or for another reason deemed legitimate by a majority of the Solid Team. In these cases an interim individual may be nominated.

If a Solid Team member not on a leave of absence drops out of touch and cannot be contacted or fails to contribute positively for a month or longer, then the rest of the Solid Team may vote to remove that team member and nominate another to replace them.

## Team Nominations

The Solid Team may decide by majority vote to expand the size of the team. It may also need to fill a vacancy on the team. In either case, this nomination process will be used to propose new team members for addition to the team.

Any Solid Team member may nominate someone for addition to the team. Team members are accepted only through majority vote of the current Solid Team.

The Solid Team should reflect the diversity of individuals and organizations in the Solid Ecosystem. Candidates nominated for consideration must be able to demonstrate substantial and beneficent contribution to the Solid ecosystem.

## Conflicts of Interest

Solid Team members are trusted to act in the best interests of Solid rather than themselves or their employers. Violation may result in removal from the team through a vote of no confidence.

## Vote of No Confidence

In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the Solid Team against their will. For example, due to egregious and ongoing code of conduct violations. Removal of a Solid Team member must be supported by a majority vote of the Solid Team, with explicit approval by the Solid Leader.

# Solid Panels

Solid Panels are individual groups focused on a specific technical or non-technical domain that are sanctioned by the Solid Team. For example, a Security Panel could be tasked with evaluation and advancement of the Solid security model. A Specification Panel could be tasked with evolution of the Solid Specification. Proposed, Active, and Archived Solid Panels are [listed here](solid-panels.md).

A new Panel is sanctioned by a majority vote of the Solid Team. Requests for the formation of a new Panel may be submitted to any member of the Solid Team. To be considered, a Panel must be able to demonstrate a clear and substantial benefit to the Solid Mission, and must maintain that trajectory to remain active. Benefit and trajectory are measured by the Solid Team. Not all Panels will be expected to persist indefinitely.

All Solid Panel members need to demonstrate a firm grasp of the philosophy of the Solid Project and the Solid Roadmap. They must demonstrate a track record of being constructive and collaborative, and a willingness to dedicate time to advance the Solid Mission through their work on the Panel.

The Solid Team may consult one or more Panels for advice on occasion when an internal Solid Team vote is not sufficient. Sufficiency is judged by the Solid Team. The Solid Team can request a vote on issues that they feel are important to open up to one or more Solid panels.

## Panel Mandate

Every Solid Panel is expected to actively contribute to the evolution of Solid in a way that supports the Solid Roadmap and the healthy growth of the Solid Ecosystem. Panel members are expected to act as custodians of Solid, within and outside of the community.

Every Panel will have a stated purpose that can be mapped directly to the Solid Roadmap, and the Solid Team may task that Panel with specific initiatives to be completed as part of the fulfillment of its mandate. For example, the Specification Panel could be tasked with an initiative to complete the next major version of the Solid Specification.

## Decision Making

Solid Panels are expected to use the Decision Making Framework [articulated herein](decision-making-process), to be transparent in work being conducted under their mandate, and to provide regular status updates through established channels.

Solid Panels should always strive to operate in a manner that aims for consensus without the need for formalized voting. When voting is necessary, stalemates are resolved by a majority vote of the Solid Team. The Solid Team reserves the right to raise any decisions made or in-process within a Panel to a vote by the Solid Team.

## Panel Nominations

An individual can be nominated to a Panel by:
- A Solid Team Member
- A member of the Panel in question
- A member of another Panel
- Self-nomination

An individual's experience and skillset must clearly align with the Panel they are nominated to. Positive contribution to existing Solid project initiatives is weighed heavily in their favor, but not required.

Panel members must be approved by a majority vote of the Panel (if already established), and a majority vote of the Solid Team. An individual may belong to more than one Panel. A Solid Team member may participate as a member of a Panel.

## Vacancies

A Solid Panel member may resign their position at any time. Whenever there is a vacancy in a Solid Panel, a new Panel member may be nominated and selected through the mechanism [articulated herein](#panel-nominations).

## Conflicts of Interest

Solid Panel members are trusted to act in the best interests of Solid rather than themselves or their employers. Violation may result in removal from the panel through a vote of no confidence.

## Vote of No Confidence

In exceptional circumstances, a Panel may need to be dissolved by a majority vote of the Solid Team.

It may also be necessary to remove someone from a Solid Panel against their will. For example, due to egregious and ongoing code of conduct violations. Removal of a Solid Panel member must be supported by a majority vote of the Solid Panel in question. The Solid Team also reserves the right to remove a Panel member, or to veto the removal of a Panel member, through a majority vote of the Solid Team.

# Decision Making Process

We employ a framework for making decisions on the Solid Team and across Solid Panels. As a general rule, this framework should be applied to any substantial choices at a Team or Panel level to ensure informed and thoughtful decisions.

This process may take place on or across different mediums. Wherever it transpires, what is most important is that the process is inclusive for those individuals that have a part in making the decision, and transparent for those who would be impacted by the same.

1. __Identify the Problem__ - The problem and the reason why the problem needs to be solved must be well understood. This includes an understanding of how solving the problem supports the Solid Roadmap.

2. __Lay out Options__ - Detail reasonable paths forward, including pros and cons for each option. This is important to ensure that informed decisions are made.

3. __Invite Conversation__ - Ensure that decision makers and (in most cases) affected parties have reviewed the material and have the ability to provide their input. Oftentimes, this occurs within Github, but can extend out into group calls, group chats, community meetings, and more.

4. __Reach Consensus or Vote__ - Decision makers should strive to reach a simple consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, they should conduct a vote by simple majority.

5. __Document and Communicate__ - Once a decision is made, the reason why should be documented, and then included as part of a notification through established communication channels (as appropriate).
