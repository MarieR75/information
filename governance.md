# Solid Governance
This document defines the formal governance process for Solid, and records how this has changed over time. 

Currently, governance is based around the Solid Team who may also consult the Solid Panel for direction via a vote on occasion. 

The scope of Solid governance includes but is not limited to changes to: the Solid specification, Solid test suite, [Solid roadmap](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-roadmap.md), [Solid Projects](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) i.e. a GitHub project in the Solid Github account, communication channels to use for Solid conversations. 

The Solid Team has broad authority, which they seek to exercise as rarely as possible, when necessary to ensure the viability and integrity of Solid, while at the same time fostering a collaborative, transparent, and supportive environment for contribution. The Solid Leader heads the Solid Team and can veto decisions and adjust direction as they see fit. 

The first Solid Team including Mitzi László, Kjetil Kjernsmo, Ruben Verborgh, and Justin Bingham is appointed directly by the Solid Leader for a five year appointment. Following Solid Teams will be selected via election.  

Solid governance as explained here in gitub.com/solid/information/governance.md has been written over several weeks in public and has been communicated clearly at the weekly W3C Solid Community Group meetings before being presented to the Solid Leader for final approval. The Solid Leader needs to approve any decision making processes for it to be legitimate. Solid governance is to be reviewed when there are one thousand eligible candidates for the Solid Panel (see description of Solid Panel below) and will not be edited in the iterim so as to provide stability to focus on the building of Solid. 

# Solid Team

The [Solid Team](solid-team.md) are dedicated trusted stewards of Solid fulfilling [roles and responsibilities](solid-team.md#solid-team-roles). 

The Solid Team currently consists of: 
* Tim Berners-Lee
* Mitzi László
* Kjetil Kjernsmo
* Ruben Verborgh 
* Justin Bingham 

## Team Mandate

The mandate of the Solid Team includes but is not limited to:

* __Solid Culture__ - Ensure that the Solid culture makes contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible  while maintaining the quality and stability of Solid. Providing clarity and fair implementation of appropriate decision-making processes and seeking consensus among those building on Solid and using Solid before acting in a formal capacity. Acting as a court of final appeal for decisions where all other methods have failed. Coordinating the definition of the Solid values so they are accurate and inclusive. Make contributing and/or participating in the evolution of Solid as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible.
* __Solid Governance__ - Implement appropriate decision-making processes, ensuring that decisions and associated processes are always aimed towards furtherance of Solid. Coordinate votes with the Solid panel by defining the question clearly and neutrally, communicating the vote to all relevant parties effectively, and collecting the opinions of all relevant parties fairly and neutrally as well as communicating the outcome of the vote. Where necessary, act as a court of final appeal for decisions where all other methods have failed. 
* __Solid Communication__ - Promoting awareness of Solid and coordinating the several parties implementing the Solid specification. Providing an updated list of Solid solutions. Fostering awareness and use of Solid across geographic, economic, industrial, and academic verticals.
* __Solid Specification__ - Guiding the evolution of the Solid Specification, with an aim to encourage constructive dialogue and foster changes that result in healthy successive iterations aligned with the Solid Roadmap. Coordinating the definition of the Solid specifications including from technical, legal, and design perspectives. 
* __Solid Compliance__ - Creation and curation of the [Solid Test Suite](https://github.com/solid/test-suite), which any Solid specification compliant server must pass to be considered a fully compliant implementation. Coordinating the development of a Solid Test suite to automate the checking of compliance of solutions to the Solid specifications. 
* __Solid Projects__ - Providing examples of the Solid specification under open source licensing. Sanction and oversight of any repositories hosted under the [Solid GitHub organization](https://github.com/solid/), including sanctioned initiatives undertaken by Solid Panel groups and/or the Solid Team, and open source community reference implementations of the Solid Specification in different languages and technical stacks.
* __Solid Roadmap__ - Curation of the Solid Roadmap comprised of a description of the Solid mission and key success factors. The Solid Team works to ensure that any and all decisions, priorities, and output are always in alignment with the Solid Roadmap.
* __Solid Website__ - Curation and Management of the [Solid Website](https://www.solidproject.org).
* __Solid Brand__ - Definition and evolution of the Solid Brand, including any associated brand assets.
* __Solid Communication Channels__ - Sanction and oversight of official Solid project communication mediums, such as chatrooms, forums, mailing lists, and message boards.

The Solid Team has broad authority to make decisions about Solid. For example, they can: 
* Formally accept or reject suggestions (usually in the form of a GitHub pull request or issue) 
* Enforce or update the Solid project's code of conduct 
* Manage Solid assets and infrastructure, including the Solid Github organisation and repositories, the bug tracker, mailing lists, conversation channels etc.

However, the Solid Team cannot modify this decision making process or affect the membership of the Solid Panel (see below for description of Solid Panel), except via the mechanisms specified in this decision making process document. 

The Solid Team should look for ways to use these powers as little as possible. Instead of voting it's better to seek consensus. Instead of ruling on individuals it's better to define standard processes for decision making. It's better to establish a Code of Conduct committee than to rule on individual cases, etc. 

## Solid Team Nomination

A new Solid Team is elected after five years.

Following Solid Teams will be appointed through election. A Solid Team election consists of two phases: 
* Phase 1: Candidates advertise their interest in serving. Candidates must be nominated by a Solid team member. Self-nominations are allowed.

* Phase 2: Each individual on the Solid Panel can vote for zero to five of the candidates. Voting is performed anonymously. Candidates are ranked by the total number of votes they receive. If a tie occurs, it may be resolved by mutual agreement among the candidates, or else the winner will be chosen at random.

Each phase lasts one to two weeks and should be publicly communicated. The election process is managed by the Election Manager nominated by the outgoing Solid Team. 

The Solid Team should ideally reflect the diversity of individuals building on Solid and using Solid. The Solid Decision  Panel is encouraged to vote accordingly.

## Soild Team Removal 

Solid Team members may resign their position at any time. 

Solid Team members may take sick leave or pregnancy leave and an election will take place to appoint an interim individual. 

If a Solid Team member not on a leave of absence drops out of touch and cannot be contacted, then the rest of the Solid Team may vote to initiate an Solid Team election as described. 

Whenever there is a vacancy during the regular Solid Team term, an election will take place as described above to appoint a replacement to serve out the rest of the term.

In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the Solid Team against their will. (For example: egregious and ongoing code of conduct violations.) This can be accomplished by a Solid Panel vote, but unlike other votes, this requires at least a two-thirds majority.

A no-confidence vote is triggered when a Solid Panel member calls for one publically on an appropriate project communication channel, and ten other Solid Panel members second the proposal. The vote lasts for two weeks. Solid Panel members vote for or against. If at least two thirds of voters express a lack of confidence, then the vote succeeds.

There are two forms of no-confidence votes: those targeting a single member, and those targeting the Solid Team as a whole. The initial call for a no-confidence vote must specify which type is intended. If a single-member vote succeeds, then that member is removed from the Solid Team and the resulting vacancy can be handled in the usual way. If a whole-Solid Team vote succeeds, the Solid Team is dissolved and a new Solid Team election is triggered immediately.

## Conflicts of Interest

Solid Team members are trusted to act in the best interests of Solid rather than themselves or their employers, the mere appearance of any one company dominating Solid development could itself be harmful and erode trust . In order to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, at most 2 members of the Solid Team can work for any single employer. This does not apply for the first appointment of the first Solid Team because there is a single dominant employer working on Solid at the time. 

In a Solid Team election, if 3 of the top 5 vote-getters work for the same employer, then whichever of them ranked lowest is disqualified and the 6th-ranking candidate moves up into 5th place; this is repeated until a valid Solid Team is formed.

During a Solid Team term, if changing circumstances cause this rule to be broken (for instance, due to a Solid Team member changing employment), then one or more Solid Team members must resign to remedy the issue, and the resulting vacancies can then be filled as normal election.

## Solid Team Decision Making

Decisions about Solid other than appointing individuals to roles, such as those listed below, are made in the following way. 
* Changes to the Solid specification
* Changes to the [Solid roadmap](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-roadmap.md)
* Changes to the Solid Test Suite
* Starting or changing the aim or project manager of a [Solid Project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) i.e. a GitHub project in the Solid Github account

To use its powers, the Solid Team votes. The Solid leader can always veto the voting outcome. Every Solid Team member  must either vote or explicitly abstain. Members with conflicts of interest on a particular vote must abstain. Passing requires a strict majority of non-abstaining Solid Team members.

Whenever possible, the Solid Team's deliberations and votes shall be held in public.

This process may take place on or across different mediums. Wherever it transpires, what is most important is that the process is inclusive for those individuals that have a part in making the decision, and transparent for those who would be impacted by the same.

The Solid Team make decisions together through a conversation. For any substantial decisions where consensus cannot be reached, the Solid Team votes. Any Solid Team member can request a quick majority vote internally within the Solid Team of a particular question.The Solid Team always strives to operate in a manner that aims for team consensus without the need for formalised voting.

During a Solid Team vote, every Solid Team member must either vote or explicitly abstain. Passing requires a strict majority of non-abstaining Solid Team members. Stalemates are resolved by the Solid Leader.  The Solid Leader can always veto the voting outcome. Decisions will be documented transparently along with the rationale and considerations taken into account around a given decision. 

The Solid Team can consult the Solid Panel for advice as described in the Consultation process below. 

Most decisions can be made through conversation. If three members of the Solid Panel raise a concern about the decision of the Solid Team that triggers the voting process as explained in the Elaborate Consultation Process. 

## Standard Consultation Process

Step 1. Making a Suggestion 
Anyone can suggest a change by getting a GitHub account and submitting a pull request or issues to the relevant repository on the Solid GitHub account. 

__Identify the Problem__ - The problem and the reason why the problem needs to be solved must be well understood. This includes an understanding of how solving the problem supports the Solid Roadmap.

__Lay out Options__ - Detail reasonable paths forward, including pros and cons for each option. This is important to ensure that informed decisions are made.

Step 2. Inviting a Conversation around your Suggestion to Find Consensus
You can post the pull request or issue on the relevant channels to invite conversation. 

Anyone can suggest routes forward to the suggested changes with pros and cons of each route forward on the original pull request or issues. 

Below is a possible table format where all the final suggested routes forward, pros and cons could be included when the conversation becomes longer and more complex. 

| Route Forward | Pros to Consider | Cons to Consider |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (insert suggestion)  | (insert suggestion)  | (insert suggestion)  |

This step is to make sure that everyone has a chance to voice their thoughts on all the options and their opinions of each so that they feel that all the options are given a chance.

If the suggestion is a change to the Solid specification you will then need to get a W3C account and join the W3C Solid Community Group to raise a conversation about your suggestion as an item on the weekly call agenda. By adding the item to the agenda all members of the W3C Solid Community Group will be automatically notified and therefore are able to comment on the pull request or issue directly. If the suggestion is a change to the Solid specification then you will need to state why this change is necessary. For example, is it to remove ambiguity or to provide a more beautiful solution to something that is already solved.

__Invite Conversation__ - Ensure that decision makers and (in most cases) affected parties have reviewed the material and have the ability to provide their input. Oftentimes, this occurs within Github, but can extend out into group calls, group chats, community meetings, and more.

Step 3. Coming to a Conclusion through Compromise  
The Solid Team will make a decision about if to include the suggestion. The original pull request or issue needs to be open for one week unless it's a typo correction.

__Reach Consensus__ - Decision makers should strive to reach a simple consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, they should conduct a vote by simple majority as explained in the elaborate consultation process.

__Document and Communicate__ - Once a decision is made, the reason why should be documented, and then included as part of a notification through established communication channels (as appropriate).

## Elaborate Consultation Process 
The voting process occurs in the following way. The Solid Team collects the options, pros, and cons, and then make sure that everyone on the Solid Panel receives a complete copy of all the information via the github pull request and issue.

Each individual in the Panel has one vote even if they have multiple criteria for being in the Solid panel, so each person in the Panel has an equal voice. Each individual can vote on a first and second choice, or they can abstain. Each individual in the Panel has seven days to vote. If the individaul does not vote after seven days their vote will automatically be counted as an abstaining vote. After counting the first choice votes, the votes from the bottom three options get transferred to the second choice vote to avoid strategic voting that does not reflect the true opinion of the Panel. The votes are recounted and the majority vote wins. 

The Solid Team's responsibilities are to:  
* make sure everyone on the Panel is aware of the vote
* explain how they can vote
* collect the final results
* communicate the outcome

Solid specification 0.9 will be released on July 1st, and new versions of the Solid specification will be released every six months. For a change to the Solid specification to be merged there needs to be at least one working implemetation that adheres to the changed Solid specification.

# History 

The Solid project was started by Tim Berners-Lee, who has served as the Solid Leader from inception. If there is a difference of opinion, parties are encouraged to talk to find a compromise. The Solid Specification Repository Manager is responsible for processing the suggestion to a change to the Solid specifications and deciding on the route forward. The repository manager of the repository to which the suggestion pertains to will be responsible for merging and closing the pull request or issue.  If a compromise cannot be met the Solid Leader will make the final judgement.
